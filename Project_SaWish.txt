Concept of The Game- 
- So one user will invite or send request through username to another user (possible the person with the possiblity of future relationship). They both will costimise there basic character in start, in start they will have nothing to wear or other accessory they can only be acquired when gifted by partner. IM a cartoon designer so its easy for me to make characters and there cloths that they will wear (it will be in layers or replacing the previous one of that same catagary i will be adding those time to time in app). Gifts can be purchased by partner using coins which can be earned by playing various games. If something is purchased from the Gift page it will be sent to the partner and its value will be recorded in there account with lable Hearts, Hearts can be spent in sending Lines and also claming discount on gift items in actual giftstore website. there will be another thing represented by Start which is the streek of sending gift everyday, within gap from next day anythime to continue streek to 48 hr from the previous sending time(at every stage something will unlock which will be a surprise).
- There will be a big role of soundeffects. every big thing like purchase, gifting, sending line, wining loosing game, changing cloths, unlocking etc will have a soundeffect.
- The App will be made for Phone Keepin the phone deminsons in mind. The app should look and feel megical, and with good smooth premium animations and design.
